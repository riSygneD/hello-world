# hello-world
Testing out GitHub.

Hello! I'm riSygneD, an aspiring game developer learning to use GitHub.
I have very basic skills in Java, Javascript, Python, and GML (Game Maker Studio's scripting language).
I'm hoping to learn how to make proper readable code and get some projects to a point where I'm happy to posting them here.
